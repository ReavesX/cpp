Variables:


Variables are containers which hold data, you can manipulate; store; or display information within the program. 

Basically a variable is a memory unit we can access by typing the name of it. 

Each variable has a **unique** name and **value** 


variables can be of different types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc.
In C, variables must be declared before they can be used.

example:
var_type var_name = value;

int age = 30;
float temperature = 36.6f; 
char initial = 'A';
double pi = 3.141519265359d;


the f after float is essential, called a literal suffix -- it tells the compiler that this IS a float. Floats only have 7 decimals of precision. 

Similarly, doubles are used to store decimal point number, but with double preceision (15-17 digits of precision.)
